"# DevOps_Project_backend"

# This is the backend for helloyou.netlify.app

It uses:

- Fastify which is a web framework
- Mongoose which provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model the application data.
- fastify-swagger which is a Swagger documentation generator for Fastify. It uses the schemas you declare in your routes to generate a swagger compliant doc.
- and Boom that provides a set of utilities for returning HTTP errors.
